## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)

### Step 2: Add Your Property

1. Click **"Add property"**
2. Choose **"Domain"** property type
3. Enter: `celebslinks.com` (without https://)
4. Click **"Continue"**

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google will give you several verification methods. Choose the easiest one:

1. Download the verification HTML file from Search Console
2. Place it in `/Users/kewlspidey/Dev/CelebLink/public/`
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Click "Verify" in Search Console

#### Option B: HTML Meta Tag (Recommended)

1. Copy the verification code from Search Console
   - It looks like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXXXX" />`
2. Extract just the content value: `XXXXXXXXXX`
3. Update `app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'XXXXXXXXXX', // Replace with your actual code
},
```

4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Click "Verify" in Search Console

#### Option C: Google Analytics (If you use it)

1. If you have Google Analytics already set up
2. Use the same Google account
3. Search Console will auto-verify

#### Option D: Google Tag Manager (If you use it)

1. If you have GTM set up
2. Use the same Google account
3. Search Console will auto-verify

### Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

Once verified:

1. In Search Console, go to **"Sitemaps"** (left sidebar)
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. Status should show "Success" within a few minutes

### Step 5: Request Indexing

For immediate indexing:

1. Go to **"URL Inspection"** (top of Search Console)
2. Enter: `https://celebslinks.com`
3. Click **"Request indexing"**
4. Repeat for any important URLs

  <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
  <priority>1.0</priority>
</url>
```

User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/

User-agent: Googlebot-Image

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Create More Indexable Pages

Dynamic connection pages are great, but also create:
- `/popular` - Most searched connections
- `/recent` - Recently discovered connections
- `/categories/entertainment`, `/categories/sports`, etc.
- Individual celebrity profile pages

### 2. Add a Blog

Consider adding:
- `/blog` - Interesting celebrity connection stories
- "Top 10 Surprising Celebrity Connections"
- "How We Find These Connections"
- SEO-friendly content that ranks

### 3. Generate Dynamic Sitemaps

Update `app/sitemap.ts` to include popular connections:

```typescript
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next';

export default async function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  const baseUrl = 'https://celebslinks.com';

  // Static pages
  const routes = [
    {
      url: baseUrl,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'daily' as const,
      priority: 1,
    },
  ];

  // Add popular connection pages
  const popularConnections = [
    // Add your popular celebrity pairs here
    { from: 'Q123', to: 'Q456' }, // Example
  ];

  popularConnections.forEach(({ from, to }) => {
    routes.push({
      url: `${baseUrl}/connection/${from}/${to}`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
      priority: 0.8,
    });
  });

  return routes;
}
```

### 4. Monitor Search Console Weekly

Check for:
- Indexing errors
- Mobile usability issues
- Security problems
- Manual actions

### 5. Optimize for Social Sharing

Your Open Graph tags are good, but also:
- Create shareable connection images
- Add social share buttons
- Use engaging titles and descriptions
