**First Comment (Post immediately after launch):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! üëã

I built CelebLink because I was fascinated by the "Six Degrees" concept but wanted
PROOF - not just speculation.

Some surprising things I learned building this:
‚Ä¢ Most Hollywood actors connect in 2-3 hops through major movies
‚Ä¢ Political leaders often bridge entertainment and other fields
‚Ä¢ Historical figures connect through surprisingly few intermediaries

The hardest part was validating that people were actually photographed together,
not just "might have met." The AI was hallucinating connections, so I added
3 layers of validation:
1. QID verification (catches wrong Wikidata entries)
2. Photo URL validation (both names must be in the URL)
3. Timeline validation (rejects anachronistic meetings)

Would love your feedback! What celebrity pair should I try next?

Try these for fun:
‚Ä¢ Your favorite actor ‚Üí Albert Einstein
‚Ä¢ Any Bollywood star ‚Üí Any Hollywood star
‚Ä¢ Modern politicians ‚Üí Historical figures
```

**Images to Upload:**
1. Homepage screenshot
2. Example connection result (with photos)
3. Share button screenshot
4. Mobile view
