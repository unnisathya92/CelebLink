# Google AdSense Setup Guide

## üéØ Strategic Ad Placement

The app includes **2 non-intrusive ad placements**:

1. **After Results Ad**: Shows only when connections are found (horizontal banner)
2. **Footer Ad**: Subtle ad at the bottom of the page (responsive)

Both ads are designed to blend with the app's aesthetic and won't interfere with user experience.

```

  format="horizontal"  // Options: 'auto', 'fluid', 'rectangle', 'vertical', 'horizontal'
  responsive={true}
  className="max-w-3xl"
